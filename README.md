# Drosophila-Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo-model
Code for our manuscript "A Markov chain Monte Carlo model of
mechanical-feedback-driven progressive
apical constrictions captures the fluctuating
collective cell dynamics in the Drosophila embryo" 
by Guoâ€“Jie J. Gao, Michael C. Holcomb, Jeffrey H. Thomas, and Jerzy Blawzdziewicz.

To run the code:
Step 1) Compile main.f by typing "ifort main.f" on a unix / linux / Mac computer.
An Intel Fortran compiler is needed.

Step 2) Run the executable by typing 
"./a.out < input_file". The executable will read an initial configuration "IC" automatically.
